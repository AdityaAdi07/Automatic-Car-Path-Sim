# Autonomous Vehicle Routing Algorithm

A modern, interactive simulation platform for testing and visualizing autonomous vehicle routing algorithms in dynamic environments. Built with React and TypeScript, this project features real-time pathfinding, city and warehouse map layouts, and advanced obstacle and traffic handling.

## üöó Project Overview

This project simulates autonomous vehicles navigating through complex environments (city and warehouse) with dynamic obstacles, traffic conditions, and pedestrian interactions. It is designed for research, education, and demonstration of advanced routing and pathfinding algorithms.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Map**: Switch between city and warehouse layouts with a professional, responsive UI.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Multiple vehicles with real-time routing, rerouting, and collision avoidance.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Buildings, traffic zones (high/medium/low), and moving pedestrians.
- **Smart Rerouting**: Vehicles proactively reroute to avoid obstacles, traffic, and other cars.
- **Pedestrian & Car Sensing**: Vehicles slow down or reroute when sensing pedestrians or other cars ahead.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Live vehicle stats, health, speed, and decision logs.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with responsive controls and map selection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: SVG, Lucide Icons
- **Simulation Logic**: Custom pathfinding and traffic simulation in TypeScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/yourusername/Autonomous-Vehicle-Routing-Algorithm.git
